# nuclei-template-search
A script to search the templates for what you need.

script will ask you to supply the template directory on the first run. After that it will remember the path. If you need to use a temporary custom path just add `--template-folder`.

The script calls python3 from the `/opt/homebrew/bin/` folder. That's right, it's written on a Mac. Adjust as needed.
